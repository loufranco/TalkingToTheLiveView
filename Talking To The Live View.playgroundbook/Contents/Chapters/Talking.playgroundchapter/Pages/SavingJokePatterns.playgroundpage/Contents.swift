// And this line pulls it back out

    do {
        // Try to make a joke from the value...
        let joke = try JokePattern(playgroundValue: value)

        // ...and view with inline results.
        joke

        // If something goes wrong, take a look at the error with the inline results.

/*:

 This initializer on `JokePattern` is the same mechanism that Em uses to decode the `PlaygroundValue` in the live view process. Take a look at `Sources/JokePattern.swift` for how it works and the possible errors that can happen if the `PlaygroundValue` isn't formed as the expected dictionary.
 
 And that is a quick summary of talking to the always-on live view from the code running in the editor!
